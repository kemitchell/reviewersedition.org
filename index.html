    <h1>Reviewers Edition</h1>
    <p>The Reviewers Edition system is a standardized, readable, and computable way to mark versions of useful prose documents, like policies and legal forms.  Reviewers Edition numbers give document authors a simple, clear, and concise way to tell document users how much has changed, and what they should review, as documents evolve over time.</p>

    <h2 id=editions>Editions</h2>

    <p>Reviewers Editions are written in short codes, like <code>1e</code>.  You can read this code “first edition”: <code>1</code> for “first” and <code>e</code> for “edition”.  <code>12e</code> is “twelfth edition”.  And so on.</p>

    <p>Publishing an edition, like <code>9e</code>, followed by a higher-numbered edition, like <code>10e</code>, sends a specific message to users.  Users of <code>9e</code> should review the entire text of new <code>10e</code> to decide if the new edition meets their needs, as <code>9e</code> did.</p>

    <aside class=example>
      <p>Jane publishes a form nondisclosure agreement as <code>1e</code>.  Later on, Jane completely redrafts the form and publishes her new version as <code>2e</code>.</p>

      <p>Bob used <code>1e</code> with business clients for several months.  On seeing new <code>2e</code>, he understands he should read <code>2e</code> top to bottom to see if it will work with his business and clients.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2 id=updates>Updates</h2>

    <p>Authors often update documents to add or remove material, leaving most of the document the same.  Reviewers Editions like <code>1e1u</code>, read “first edition, first update”, or <code>10e15u</code>, read “tenth edition, fifteenth update”, describe these changes.</p>

    <p>Publishing a new update to an old edition sends a specific message to users.  Users of a <code>10e</code> should compare new <code>10e1u</code> to old <code>10e</code>, and review what has changed, to see whether the changes serve their needs.  Users of a <code>10e7u</code> should compare a new <code>10e10u</code> and review what has changed.  But users of a <code>10e</code> should review a new <code>11e1u</code> top-to-bottom, since the author used a higher edition number.</p>

    <aside class=example>
      <p>Adam publishes a form product-returns policy as <code>7e</code>.  SuperMart reviews <code>7e</code> and begins using it in stores.</p>

      <p>Adam later changes <code>7e</code> to replace language about cash refunds.  Since the rest of the policy remains the same, Adam publishes his newly revised policy as <code>7e1u</code>.  SuperMart's team sees new <code>7e1u</code>, compares it to <code>7e</code>, which they’re already using, and reviews the new language on cash refunds.  Since SuperMart prefers the old language on cash refunds, so they stick with <code>7e</code> in their stores.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2 id=corrections>Corrections</h2>

    <p>Some changes to useful documents don’t add, remove, or change meaningful pieces of language, but merely correct spelling, structural, or other technical errors.  Reviewers Editions like <code>3e1c</code>, read “third edition, first correction”, or <code>7e11u3c</code>, read “seventh edition, eleventh update, third correction”, describe these changes.</p>

    <p>Publishing a new correction to an old edition or update sends a specific message to users.  Users of a <code>10e</code> should use <code>10e1c</code> instead, and can do so without reviewing the changes.  Of course, users may always <em>choose</em> to review the changes.  But correction numbers in the Reviewers Edition system allow authors to communicate when changes go to form, rather than substance.</p>

    <aside class=example>
      <p>Professor Miller publishes a privacy notice for medical patients as <code>3e3u</code>.  Doctor Waller begins using <code>3e3u</code> in his practice.</p>

      <p>Professor Miller later spots a spelling error.  She quickly corrects it, and publishes a new <codE>3e3u1c</code>.  As soon as Doctor Waller sees that a new <code>3e3u1c</code> is available, he begins using it, wondering why he hadn’t spotted the typo himself.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2 id=drafts>Drafts</h2>

    <p>Document authors often create working drafts before publishing final versions.  Reviewers Editions like <code>8e1d</code>, read “first draft of eighth edition”, or <code>2e1u5c3d</code>, read “third draft of second edition, first update, fifth correction”, describe these drafts.</p>

    <p>Publishing a document with a draft number sends a specific message to users.  Users of a <code>10e3u</code> should continue to use <code>10e3u</code>, even when <code>10e3u1c1d</code>, <code>10e3u4d</code>, or <code>11e15d</code> are available.  Authors working together to create a <code>13e</code> should review <code>13e7d</code> instead of old <code>13e6d</code>.</p>

    <aside class=example>
      <p>A community advocacy group is preparing a form community foundation charter.  The lead drafter prepares an initial draft, <code>1e1d</code>.  After a round of comments, the group produces <code>1e2d</code>.</p>

      <p>Bob wants to start a community foundation for his local neighborhood.  He sees the advocacy group’s <code>1e2d</code> online.  Since he does not see a final <code>1e</code>, he contacts the advocacy group to ask about the status of the form project.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2 id=review>Review</h2>

    <p>Reviewers Edition numbers are written as codes, like <code>3e4u1c2d</code>:</p>

    <pre>
                3e  4u  1c  2d

                │   │   │   │
third edition ──┘   │   │   │
                    │   │   │
    fourth update ──┘   │   │
    (optional)          │   │
                        │   │
     first correction ──┘   │
     (optional)             │
                            │
             second draft ──┘
             (optional)</pre>

    <p>Changes to the four numbers send different messages to users:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Increasing <em>edition</em> numbers tells users of lower-numbered editions to review the entire document, top-to-bottom, to decide whether it meets their needs.</li>

      <li>Adding or increasing <em>update</em> numbers tells users of lower-numbered updates to review the parts that have changed to decide whether it meets their needs.</li>

      <li>Adding or increasing <em>correction</em> numbers tells users that they should always use the newly corrected version.</li>

      <li>Adding and increasing <em>draft</em> numbers tells users that the particular revision is a new working draft.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id=software>Computer Software</h2>

    <p>Even if you don&rsquo;t write computer software yourself, you should know that Reviewers Edition codes are easy for computer programs to read and interpret.  This makes it possible to write computer programs to analyze documents marked with Reviewers Edition codes.</p>

    <p>Software procedures to parse, create, interpret, compare, and explain Reviewers Edition codes are currently available <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=reviewers-edition>in the JavaScript programming language</a>.
